### FULL SCRIPT

**[HOOK]**

If you’re a college student right now, let me guess:

too many subjects, too many deadlines, and not enough time or energy.

You sit down to study…

and two hours later, you’ve scrolled Instagram, panicked, and learned almost nothing.

What if I told you there are **AI tools** that can help you study smarter—not longer—in 2025?

In this video, I’ll show you **5 AI tools every college student must use**, and exactly how you can start using them today.

Trust me, the last tool is a game-changer.

### **[INTRO]**

Hey everyone, I’m Faizal.

I’m a college student, just like you, and over the last year I’ve been experimenting with AI tools to manage my studies better.

I’m not here to help you cheat.

I’m here to help you **understand faster, organize better, and reduce stress**.

So if you’re tired of feeling behind all the time, let’s get into it.

### **TOOL 1: ChatGPT – Your Personal Study Buddy**

ChatGPT is one of the most powerful learning tools if you use it correctly.

Instead of just asking random questions, use it like a tutor.

For example:

If you don’t understand a concept, ask

“Explain marginal costing like I’m a first-year student.”

You can also paste your textbook content and say:

“Summarize this chapter into simple revision notes.”

Before exams, you can ask it to generate practice questions with answers.

The key is this:

don’t blindly copy. Read, ask follow-up questions, and actually learn.

Used properly, ChatGPT can save you **hours**.

### **TOOL 2: Notion AI – Notes & Organization**

If ChatGPT helps your brain think, Notion AI helps your brain stay organized.

You can store:

- Notes
- Assignments
- Exam schedules
- To-do lists

The AI feature helps you convert messy notes into clean summaries.

For example:

After class, paste your rough notes and ask Notion AI to organize them under headings.

You can even create revision pages for each subject.

Less chaos, more clarity.

### **TOOL 3: Grammarly / QuillBot – Writing Made Better**

Most students lose marks not because they don’t know answers—but because they can’t explain them clearly.

That’s where Grammarly or QuillBot helps.

You write your answer.

Paste it into the tool.

It fixes grammar, clarity, and tone.

This is perfect for assignments, emails to professors, resumes, and LinkedIn posts.

You still control the content—AI just makes it cleaner.

### **TOOL 4: Perplexity / Gemini – Smart Research**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: “AI Research Tools”]

[B-ROLL IDEA: Perplexity showing sources]

Research doesn’t have to mean opening ten Google tabs.

Tools like Perplexity and Gemini give you **answers with sources**.

For example, you can ask:

“Explain digital payments in India with recent examples and sources.”

This is extremely useful for projects and presentations.

Remember: read, understand, then rewrite in your own words.

---

### **TOOL 5: Otter.ai / TLDV – Record & Revise Lectures**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: “Lecture Transcripts”]

[B-ROLL IDEA: Transcript screen]

If you have online or hybrid classes, this tool is gold.

Otter.ai or TLDV records classes and turns them into text.

You can search the transcript instead of rewatching the full lecture.

Later, you can paste that transcript into ChatGPT or Notion AI and get short notes.

Massive time saver.

---

### **[RECAP]**

Let’s recap quickly:

ChatGPT – learning helper

Notion AI – organization

Grammarly – writing clarity

Perplexity – research

Otter.ai – revision

You don’t need all five.

Start with just one this week.
